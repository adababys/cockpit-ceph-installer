%description
This package installs a cockpit plugin that provides a graphical interface to install a Ceph cluster. The plugin itself handles UI interaction and depends on the ansible-runner-service API to handle the configuration and management of the ansible inventory and playbooks.
In addition to the plugin, the installation process also enables docker/podman which is required for the ansible-runner-service API.

Once installed, a helper script called ansible-runner-service.sh is available to handle the installation and configuration of the ansible-runner-service daemon (container).
